# Dynamic Instrumentation on Linux & Android using Frida


## Workshop details

- This is a beginner friendly, scenario driven, hands-on workshop on binary instrumentation using Frida in *nix environments
- We’ll understand some low level details of dynamic instrumentation and move towards using high level tools like Frida to instrument binaries
